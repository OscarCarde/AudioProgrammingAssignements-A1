# A1

1. I read a wav file and sliced a numpy array of audio samples to return a desired portion of the audio file
1. I used numpy max/min methods to get the maximum and minimum sample values fom an audio file
1. I reduce the number of samples in a numpy array using list slicing with a given step: `samples[::step]` 
1. using the functions from the previous parts, I down-sampled an audio file by a given factor, resulting in audible alteration of an audio file (lower resolution)
